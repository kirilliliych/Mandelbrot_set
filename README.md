# Mandelbrot_set

## Briefly
This is an implementation of Mandelbrot set.

## What it does
The program calculates Mandelbrot set. By setting defines which are in .cpp file you can enable either
massive calculations that load your system or mode that just draws the picture. Last option is provided via SFML library.

## What is the purpose
The goal is to train to optimize program using intrinsics (SIMD instructions) and to see how the performance gets upgraded because of that.
Therefore, two versions of program were written: one without intrinsics and one with them. FPS counter which is drawn at the top left corner
of the window generated by SFML library. If drawing mode is not chosen then FPS counter is outputted to the console.
